	        					Some people dislike Node.js because it is JavaScript. There are some programmers who see JavaScript's roots as a scripting language designed to add a 
		                          little interactivity to a web site as what it is today. Others look at things like dynamic typing, prototypal inheritance, and general quirkiness and just can't 
		                          understand how it can be tolerated. Some people are sick of the hype, and wonder why similar solutions 
		                          in other languages, 
		                          for example Tornado in Python are not given as much attention.
		                          Node.js was pretty much an instant hit when it was introduced. Despite its quirks JavaScript is an immensely popular language, with a horde of developers already familiar with it. 
		                        It has a very active developer community.
		                          So, Node.js is hated by some developers because it is JavaScript and seen as an inferior choice to other solutions.
